about=This plugin supports MapAction's file upload processes, allowing a zip file to be created for upload to MapAction's Maps and Data Catalogue. The plugin creates a new folder (named using the Print Composer name) in the location of the user's choice, saves the PDF and JPG files into it, then zips the folder contents into a file, also named as per the Print Composer, and saves it alongside the folder containing the exported files.
