name=Map Export
qgisMinimumVersion=2.0
description=Select a Print Composer, export a PDF, JPG and metadata, zip up the files.
version=0.1
about=This plugin supports MapAction's file upload processes, allowing a zip file to be created for upload to MapAction's Maps and Data Catalogue. The plugin creates a new folder (named using the Print Composer name) in a location of the user's choice, saves PDF and JPG exports of the Composer into it, creates a metadata XML file in the same location, then zips the folder contents, and saves it alongside the folder.
